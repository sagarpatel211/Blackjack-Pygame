# ICS3U1-Project
This project was created as part of my final assignment in *Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science*. The project was a graphical blackjack game using Pygame in Python 3.

## Disclaimers:
```diff 
- This is a naive implementation and terribly styled code (eg. global variables, not modularized, etc.) -
```
```diff 
- To run this program, you must copy all files from the Images directory into the directory with main.py -
```
